# FoodAdvisor

FoodAdvisor is a full-stack web application developed as part of the "Proyecto de Computaci√≥n I y II" course. The project is divided into two main components:

Frontend: Built with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application. Its repository can be found at https://github.com/Proyecto-de-Computacion-I-y-II/Front

Backend: Developed using PHP and Blade, handling the server-side logic and database interactions. 

# Features
The main objective of this project is to create shop lists and a food search of different supermarkets with many filters and recomendations that will help you keep a healthy diet. Upon creating several food lists, an AI powered recomendation will pop up to provide complements to your shop list.
These recomendations will be based on what your cart currently lacks, according to the ONU's food pyramid. That is, if your cart has a low proportion of vegetables compared with the rest of products, the web will provide a list of fruits and vegetables you may be interested in.
We also have a section exclusive for seasonal foods. This way you can find cheaper, fresher and healthier nourishment in our database. Additionally, any recomendation made to your cart will prioritize seasional foods.
